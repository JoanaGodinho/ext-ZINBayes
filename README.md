# Installing
1 - Install Python 3.6 or create a virtual environment (ex: conda environment) with Python 3.6.

2 - Install version 1.5.0 of the tensorflow library. If you have a Nvidia GPU install instead the tensorflow-gpu library (version 1.5.0). Be sure to have the CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN, if you are going to use tensorflow-gpu. If those two softwares are not installed the GPU will not be used even if you install tensorflow-gpu.
